# Coordinate Systems for BrainScaleS architectures

In order to configure specific components in a hardware system they have to be uniquely identifiable.
`halco` provides a coordinate system for the neuromorphic BrainScaleS platform.
In combination with the associated configurational data ([halbe](https://github.com/electronicvisions/halbe) for BrainScaleS-1 and [haldls](https://github.com/electronicvisions/haldls) for BrainScaleS-2) they provide the basis to configure the neuromorphic system.

More information about the design principle of `halco` can be found in the documentation.
The raw version can be found in [this repository](doc/index.rst).
A compiled version is hosted on [github pages](https://electronicvisions.github.io/documentation-brainscales2/halco/index.html).
